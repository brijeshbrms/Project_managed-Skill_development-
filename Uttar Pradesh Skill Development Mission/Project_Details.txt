My role — responsibilities (what I actually did)

I led end-to-end field coordination for the RPL training program. My core responsibilities included:

Stakeholder engagement & approvals — Liaised with UPSDM government officials (DPM, operators) and the local ITI principal; presented the project plan, clarified deliverables, and secured approvals.

Venue & logistics management — Booked training venues and coordinated with private vendors to set up all required logistics (seating, power, equipment placement, training materials, and safety measures).

Community mobilization — Met village leaders and residents to explain program benefits, answered concerns, and convinced eligible participants to register and join the program.

Data & record management — Created and maintained the candidate database: registration, attendance logs, feedback forms, and assessment records.

Media for reporting — Captured photographs and supporting images used by the agency and government partners to prepare official reports.

Assessment coordination — Managed assessment events at the end of training: coordinated examiners, scheduled exam slots, handled verification with government agencies, and ensured candidate readiness.

On-the-job learning — Strengthened practical skills: project management, stakeholder negotiation, field logistics, and government coordination.

Outcomes & impact

200 candidates trained (multiple batches across Belari and Ranipur).

Smooth coordination with government agencies and successful conduct of end-of-training assessments.

Clean candidate records (attendance/feedback) stored for audit and reporting.
